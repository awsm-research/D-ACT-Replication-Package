# D-ACT-Replication-Package

## Environmental Setup

  

In the main folder of the replication package, run the command below in terminal to install the required libraries (the libraries are for conda environment)

  

	conda env create -f requirement.yml

  

## A Replication Package

  

We provide scripts for our approach (D-ACT) and the baselines (i.e., AutoTransform and TufanoT5) in our study. There are 3 main directories:

  

-  `baseline`: the directory that stores source code for the baselines

-  `D-ACT`: the directory that stores source code for our approach

-  `dataset`: the directory that stores dataset

To obtain the experiment results presented in our paper, we provide the generated predictions and the script for evaluation (for more detail, please have a look at "**How to get evaluation result**" in each section).
However, you can generate the predictions yourself by follow the steps in the below sections.

### Obtaining the fine-tuned models

The fine-tuned models of all approaches (i.e., D-ACT, TufanoT5 and AutoTransform) can be obtained from this google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14MQCF5YUYX1vH2iuUf_RJX9QFtaNtQec/view?usp=sharing

To use the fine-tuned models to generate predictions, follow the below steps

- D-ACT
	- Put the directories 'model' to the corresponding directories of `./D-ACT/`

	- For example, the directory `models-for-D-ACT-papers/D-ACT/output/android/model-time-wise-with-token-level-code-diff-info/model` should be put in `D-ACT/output/android/model-time-wise-with-token-level-code-diff-info/`

- AutoTransform
	- Put the directories beginning with `model` in the directory `./baseline/AutoTransform`


- TufanoT5
	- Put the directories beginning with `pytorch_dump` in the directory `./baseline/TufanoT5`

	- Put the directories `model` to the corresponding directories of  `./baseline/TufanoT5`

	- For example, the directory `models-for-D-ACT-papers/baseline/TufanoT5/from-pytorch/output/android/T5_with_token_level_code_diff_info_time_wise/model` should be put in `./baseline/TufanoT5/from-pytorch/output/android/T5_with_token_level_code_diff_info_time_wise/`

**How to get evaluation result**


1. Go to directory `D-ACT`

2. Run the following script (you can run in an interactive mode): `get_perfect_match.py`

  
  

### Using Source Code of the Baselines

  

#### AutoTransform

  

**Steps to prepare data**

  

AutoTransform is implemented in the [Tensor2Tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor) library. Thus, to run AutoTransform, we need to convert the dataset to binary files.

  

To create binary files of the datasets for RQ1, please follow the below steps:

  

1. Go to directory `baseline/AutoTransform/scripts`

2. Run the following command

  

		bash prepare_data.sh <PROJECT>

  

where `<PROJECT>` is android, google or ovirt

  

The script will call subword_toknize.sh to tokenize the datasets by using BPE subword tokenization (for more info, please refer to [this Github](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt)). The tokenized dataset is stored in BPE-2000-time-ignore (for time-ignore evaluation) and BPE-2000-time-wise (for time-wise evaluation).

After the dataset is tokenized, the script will call generate_binary_data.py to create binary files from the tokenized dataset. The generated binary files are stored in binary-data-time-ignore (for time-ignore evaluation) and binary-data-time-wise (for time-wise evaluation) .

  
  

To create binary files of the datasets for RQ2, please follow the below steps:

  

1. Go to directory `baseline/AutoTransform/scripts-with-token-level-code-diff-info`

2. Run the following script

  

		bash prepare_data.sh <PROJECT>

  

	where `<PROJECT>` is android, google or ovirt

	<br />	

	The tokenized dataset is stored in BPE-2000-time-wise-with-code-diff-representation. After the dataset is tokenized, the script will call generate_binary_data.py to create binary files from the tokenized dataset. The generated binary files are stored in binary-data-time-wise-with-code-diff-representation.
